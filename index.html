            Mortaza displayed as an under-19 player impressed Andy Roberts, the former West Indian fast bowler, who was
            acting as a temporary bowling coach for Bangladesh. Under Roberts' recommendation, Mortaza was drafted
            into the Bangladesh A team. After one match for Bangladesh A (to date his only Bangladesh A match), Mortaza
            made his Test debut on 8 November 2001 against Zimbabwe in the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka.
